# CartLens — Market Basket Analysis & Business Insights

CartLens performs market-basket analysis on retail transaction data to surface association rules (e.g., "people who bought X also bought Y"), rank the top rules by lift, and present actionable business insights in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

This project is useful for merchandising, cross-sell recommendations, bundle suggestions, and exploratory analysis of transaction datasets.
